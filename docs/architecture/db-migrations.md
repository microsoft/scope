# Database Migrations

MongoDB migration framework powered by [mongo-migrate-ts](https://github.com/mycodeself/mongo-migrate-ts) for evolving the database schema and backfilling data.

## Overview

Migrations live in `packages/db-migrations/`. Each migration is a TypeScript file that exports a named class implementing the `MigrationInterface` from `mongo-migrate-ts`. Migrations are:

- **Ordered** — discovered alphabetically by filename, applied in that order
- **Tracked** — a `_migrations` collection records which migrations have been applied (stores `className` and `timestamp`)
- **Reversible** — each migration implements both `up()` and `down()`
- **Idempotent** — designed to be safe to re-run (upserts, `$setOnInsert`, guards)

## Running Migrations

From the repository root (`scope-mt-app/`):

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
pnpm migrate:up

# Revert the last applied migration
pnpm migrate:down

# Show migration status (applied vs pending)
pnpm migrate:status

# Scaffold a new migration file
pnpm migrate:new
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MONGODB_URI` or `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING` or `COSMOSDB_CONNECTION_STRING` | No | MongoDB connection string (default: `mongodb://localhost:27117`) |
| `MONGODB_DATABASE` or `MONGO_DATABASE` | No | Database name (default: `requests-db`) |

Defaults match the `docker-compose.yml` local dev environment, so no configuration is needed for local development.

## Writing a New Migration

1. Create a new file in `packages/db-migrations/src/migrations/` following the naming convention:

   ```
   NNN-description.ts
   ```

   Where `NNN` is a zero-padded sequence number (e.g., `002-add-indexes.ts`).

2. Export a **named** class implementing `MigrationInterface`:

   ```typescript
   import type { Db } from "mongodb";
   import type { MigrationInterface } from "mongo-migrate-ts";

   export class AddIndexes implements MigrationInterface {
     async up(db: Db): Promise<void> {
       // Apply changes
       await db.collection("requests").createIndex({ taskPromptId: 1 });
     }

     async down(db: Db): Promise<void> {
       // Revert changes (best effort)
       await db.collection("requests").dropIndex("taskPromptId_1");
     }
   }
   ```

   > **Important**: Use a **named export** (not `export default`). `mongo-migrate-ts` discovers migrations by iterating over all named exports from each file and uses the class name as the migration identifier in the `_migrations` collection.

3. Keep migrations **self-contained** — avoid importing from workspace packages (e.g., `shared`). `mongo-migrate-ts` dynamically imports migration files, which can break workspace package resolution. Inline any shared utilities directly in the migration file.

4. Test locally with `pnpm migrate:up` and `pnpm migrate:status`.

### Common patterns

- **RU-paced backfill** — use `batchUpdate(col, filter, update, label)` from `../batch-update.js` (collects `_id`s, then `updateMany({_id:{$in:batch}}, update)` in small batches with 429 retry). Static update only.
- **Per-document backfill referencing `_id`** — when the new value derives from each doc's own `_id` (e.g. `keyId = _id`), `batchUpdate` can't express it. Use a paced `bulkWrite` loop of `updateOne` ops instead (mirror `025-create-projects`), reusing `BATCH_SIZE`/`sleep`/`getRetryAfterMs` for pacing and 429 handling.
- **Idempotent index create** — wrap `createIndex` in try/catch and tolerate "already exists" codes (`85`/`86`/`68`); rethrow real failures so validation surfaces them.
- **Unique-index swap** — before creating a composite **unique** index on a non-empty collection, `$group`/`$match` to assert no duplicate keys exist first (a pre-existing collision fails index creation on Cosmos). Drop the old index tolerating "not found" (`26`/`27`). `down()` for index ops is log-only by convention.

## How It Works

The CLI entry point (`packages/db-migrations/src/migrate.ts`) configures `mongo-migrate-ts` with:

- Connection URI and database name from environment variables (with local dev defaults)
- Migration directory: `src/migrations/`
- Collection name: `_migrations`
- Glob pattern: `**/*.ts`

When you run a command:

1. `up` — applies all pending migrations in order, records each in the `_migrations` collection with `className` and `timestamp`
2. `down --last` — reverts the last applied migration, removes its record
3. `status` — prints a table showing applied (`up`) and pending migrations
4. `new` — scaffolds a new migration file in the migrations directory

## Existing Migrations

| Migration | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `001-backfill-task-prompts` | Creates `task-prompts` collection from existing `requests.scenario.task` values, links runs via `taskPromptId`, migrates prompt feature extraction data |
| `002-create-indexes` | Creates single-field indexes on all collections (see [db.md](db.md)) |
| `003-create-skill-indexes` | Adds indexes for `skills` and `skill-revisions` collections |
| `004-add-submission-id-index` | Sparse index on `requests.submissionId` for efficient filtering |
| `005-backfill-iteration-durations` | Estimates `startedAt`/`durationMs` on existing turns from timestamps |
| `006-split-status-outcome` | Splits run status into `status` (pending/processing/done) + `outcome` (succeeded/failed/exhausted) |
| `007-rename-exhausted-to-finished` | Renames outcome `exhausted` → `finished` |
| `008-backfill-ai-call-count` | Downloads HARs from blob storage to count AI completion calls per turn |
| `009-add-requests-filter-indexes` | Adds indexes on `taskPromptId`, `status`, `outcome`, `workerType`, `deletedAt` for server-side filtering/grouping |
| `025-create-projects` | Data Organization: Projects — seeds one initial project and backfills immutable `projectId` on all 16 scoped collections; backfills `task-prompts.keyId = _id`; swaps deterministic-key unique indexes to `{projectId,keyId}` / `{projectId,ref}` and adds `{projectId}` scoping indexes (see [db.md](db.md#project-scoping-migration-025)) |
| `026-isolate-catalogs-per-project` | Per-project catalog isolation for `skills`, `extensions`, `criteria`, `prompt-features` — backfills `slug = _id`, swaps global-unique `{id}`/slug indexes to `{projectId,slug}` / `{projectId,id}` (see [db.md](db.md#per-project-catalog-isolation-migration-026)) |
| `027-uuid-keys-mcp-profileversions` | Opaque UUID `_id` + reference key for `mcp-servers` (`slug`) and `profile-versions` (`ref`) with `{projectId,slug}` / `{projectId,ref}` indexes; drops dead `prompt-feature-extractions` (see [db.md](db.md#per-project-entity-keying-migration-027)) |
| `028-isolate-mcp-secrets-per-project` | Reconciles the token-manager `mcp-secrets` unique index — drops the legacy global-unique `{mcpId,name}` and (re)creates the per-project `{projectId,mcpId,name}` (see [token-manager.md](token-manager.md#mcp-secrets)) |
| `029-create-users-collection` | Creates the database-enforced unique identity index for authentication; uses Cosmos collection-creation extensions for continuous-backup accounts and preserves native MongoDB index creation (see below) |

### Migration 029: users identity uniqueness

`users.uniq_identity` must be a unique, non-sparse, unfiltered index on exactly
`(idp, idpTenant, idpSubject)` with simple collation. It guarantees one Scope user
per IdP identity. Unlike older catalog migrations, 029 **never falls back to a
non-unique identity index**. The index name is also used by the API's narrowly
scoped duplicate-key retry handling.

| Backend | New collection | Existing collection | Email index |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CosmosDB for MongoDB | `CreateCollection` includes the required `_id` index and `uniq_identity` at creation | Inspect and reuse only a compatible identity index; add the email index if missing | Non-sparse and non-unique |
| Native MongoDB | Native `createIndex` creates the collection and unique identity index | Idempotent native index creation; duplicate data and conflicting indexes remain errors | Sparse and non-unique, as before |

Backend selection uses the Cosmos extension commands, not URI heuristics. Only
an explicit unknown-command error selects the native path. Cosmos authorization,
connectivity, and index failures do not silently switch backends. Actual index
metadata is checked before the migration reports success.

Cosmos accounts using [continuous backup require unique indexes at collection
creation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/indexing#unique-indexes).
Cosmos also [does not support sparse indexes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/feature-support-70#indexes-and-index-properties),
so 029 creates a normal, non-sparse advisory email index there instead. The email
index is non-unique on both backends. This does not change email storage or authentication policy.

**Recovery is non-destructive.** If an existing Cosmos `users` collection lacks
the expected constraint, 029 stops, even if the collection is empty. It never
drops, recreates, renames, copies, or edits user data. Do not bypass the failure
by marking the migration as applied. Inspect and back up the collection, then
approve a separate recovery that preserves Scope UUIDs, roles, and references;
rerun 029 only after the collection has a compatible identity index.

Throttling and recognized collection-creation races receive bounded retries
(three attempts), with collection/index discovery repeated before each attempt.
Transport failures propagate rather than blindly repeating DDL; a later rerun
can recognize a successfully created collection after a lost response. `down()`
remains log-only.

Unit tests cover the Cosmos command contract; native MongoDB integration tests
exercise actual uniqueness, concurrency, reruns, and non-destructive failures.
**Live CosmosDB verification of the non-sparse email-index behavior is still
required.** See the [shared infrastructure guide](../shared-dev-infra.md) for
selecting a real account; use isolated test data for acceptance checks.

## CI/CD

The `db-migrations` package is compiled as part of the CI `build` job (`pnpm -r build` → `tsc`). This catches TypeScript errors in migrations before deployment.

In Kubernetes, migrations are run automatically by a Job before the API pods start. Locally, Docker Compose runs migrations automatically as well. The API readiness probe checks the `_migrations` collection against the `REQUIRED_MIGRATIONS` list — pods report "not ready" until all required migrations have been applied.
